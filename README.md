# Simulating Accessibility Personas

Chrome extension for simulating the [accessibility personas](https://github.com/alphagov/accessibility-personas) that were created by the UK Government Digital Service (GDS) and adapted by Germany's [DigitalService GmbH des Bundes](https://digitalservice.bund.de/). This is a work in progress. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

The extension simulates various impairments (e.g, low vision, dyslexia) by injecting CSS and JS files to the currently active tab. Most CSS and JS files were taken directly from the GDS repo, some were slightly modified.

## Usage

Select a persona from the extension and the current browser tab will be adjusted to simulate the persona's experience.

For some personas, you will need to install additional extensions at this point, or change your system settings (e.g., activate VoiceOver on your Mac). This is mentioned in the additional instructions for each persona.

## Installation

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file. Unzip it.

2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.

3. Activate "Developer mode" in the top-right corner.

4. Select "Load unpacked" and select the folder you downloaded from here.

5. Pin the extension (üìç) to keep it visible.

## Development

Install the project dependencies once using `npm`. To do that, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) needs to be installed on your machine. We recommend to use a version manager to handle Node.js versions, [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) with the [asdf-nodejs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs/) plugin, for example.

```bash
npm install
```

Additionally, we use [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) Git hooks which can be installed with brew:

```sh
brew install lefthook
```

### Verify that your code changes are correctly formatted

Run `npm run format:check` and afterwards `npm run format:fix` to auto format your code changes with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
A `pre-commit` lefthook Git hook will take care of checking your code before you can push it.

### Build CSS with Tailwind

Use `npm run tailwind` to build the CSS file and watch for changes.

## Release Workflow

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the process of creating a new release. The workflow is triggered whenever a new version tag (e.g., `v1.2.0`) is pushed to the repository.

This automation handles the following:

- Compiling and minifying production assets.
- Packaging only the necessary extension files into a `dist/` directory.
- Creating a versioned `.zip` file suitable for uploading to the Chrome Web Store.
- Publishing a new GitHub Release with the `.zip` file attached as a downloadable asset.

### How to Create a New Release

To publish a new version, follow these steps:

1.  **Ensure your main branch is up-to-date** and all pull requests for the release have been merged.
2.  **Update the version number.** The version must be updated in two places:

    - `manifest.json`
    - `package.json`

    This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (e.g., `major.minor.patch`).

3.  **Commit the version change.**
    ```bash
    git add manifest.json package.json package-lock.json
    git commit -m "release vX.Y.Z"
    ```
    _(Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the new version number)_
4.  **Create and push the Git tag.** This is the step that will trigger the release workflow.
    ```bash
    git tag vX.Y.Z
    ```
5.  **Push your commits and the new tag** to the repository.
    ```bash
    git push && git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ```

Once the tag is pushed, the GitHub Action will automatically create and publish the release.
