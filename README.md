# Simulating accessibility personas
Chrome extension for simulating the [accessibility personas](https://github.com/alphagov/accessibility-personas) that were created by the UK Government Digital Service (GDS) and adapted by the German DigitalService. The is a work in progress and feedback is welcome!

Various impairments (e.g, low vision, dyslexia) are simulated by injecting CSS and JS to change the appearance and behavior of websites in the currently active tab. The CSS and JS files were obtained directly from the GDS repo.


## Usage
Select a persona from the extension and the current browser tab will be adjusted to simulate the persona's experience.
